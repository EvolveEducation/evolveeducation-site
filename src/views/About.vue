      <p>
        A nonsense word, unlike a sememe, may have no definition. Nonsense words
        can be classified depending on their orthographic and phonetic
        similarity with (meaningful) words.[1] If it can be pronounced according
        to a language's phonotactics, it is a pseudoword.[2] Nonsense words are
        used in literature for poetic or humorous effect. Proper names of real
        or fictional entities are sometimes nonsense words. Nonsense words are
        also used by researchers and educators as a tool to assess a learner's
        phonetic decoding ability. The words follow phonetic rules but have no
        meaning. [3]A stunt word is a nonsense word used for a special effect,
        or to attract attention, as part of a performance. Such words are a
        feature of the work of Dr. Seuss ("Sometimes I am quite certain there's
        a Jertain in the curtain").[4] The ability to infer the (hypothetical)
        meaning of a nonsense word from context is used to test for brain
        damage.[5]
